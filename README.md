# Project - Neighborhood Map

The project as part of the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree involves developing a single page application featuring a map of our neighborhood or a neighborhood one would like to visit. Functionality is then added to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

## Getting Started

Download or clone this repository and open "index.html" in your browser.

### Ways to get around

* Click on a marker on the map to view an infowindow with a wikipedia short description and a link.
* On the left-hand sidebar, click on the filter which shows a search bar where you can filter on a marker's name. This should give matches both on the list below as well as the markers that show up on the map
* Clicking on a name in the list on the sidebar will bring up the appropriate marker and change its color.
* Clicking on the toggle bar on the top nav bar hides/unhides the sidebar
* Minimizing the window hides the sidebar (responsive design)
